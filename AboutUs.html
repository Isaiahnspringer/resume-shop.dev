<h1 class="center">About the Creator</h1>
<p class="center">Hi, Im Isaiah Springer a U.S. Army National Guard Staff Sergeant, full-stack IT Programmer, and future MBA graduate. This site is both a creative space for reviewing and discussing tech and games, and a technical demonstration of what Im learning and building.</p>

    <p class="center">Currently, Im finishing my Bachelor's in IT with a concentration in Python full-stack programming. I maintained a 3.91 GPA and plan to begin my MBA at UNC Charlotte in January 2026. My skills span Python, SQL, HTML/CSS, JavaScript, Flask, and data analysis which is everything I need to build and analyze full-featured web apps.</p>

    <p class="center">My military career has shaped my discipline and leadership. Ive trained soldiers in multiple fields including land navigation, ACFT fitness, and combat systems as a tank commander and H2F-certified instructor. I also manage a few rental properties and Airbnb's having my own finacial data reports along with maintaining perfect customer service with my tenants. These experiences now feed into my civilian goals: blending technology, analytics, and business strategy to drive performance and innovation.</p>

    <p class="center">This project showcases how I integrate code, design, and functionalityâ€”offering a real-time display of my capabilities. Whether you're a recruiter, peer, or instructor, I invite you to explore the site, examine the source, and connect with me on future opportunities.</p>
